# KaggleTools

### What is this?
This is a toolset to aid in completing Kaggle data science projects and competitions. It has been made by two undergrad
University of Chicago students -- Colin Flaherty and David Yaffe.

### Branching Model
The git repository for this project has two primary branches -- `master` and `production`. The `master` branch is left in a developmental state and regularly merged into when new features are added. Periodically, when the `master` branch is in a stable state, it will be merged into the `production` branch, which is considered the long term stable version of this project.
